# RISC-V CPU Simulator

Simulation of a RISC-V architechture CPU. The code contain the implementation of an assembler to covert RISC-V assembly to binary.This project is a simulation of a 5-stage pipelined RISC-V 32-bit CPU written in C++, along with a custom assembler that converts RISC-V assembly code to binary (little-endian format). It models the core functionalities of a RISC-V processor, including instruction execution, pipeline flow, and register/memory handling.
